    <th>Business analyst with a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering (worked for IBM and GE) and skills in Excel, VBA, Python, and SQL from the University of Arizona Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp. Self-motivated person who enjoys problem solving and analyzing data, who works productively alone and also enjoys working with others on a team. Demonstrated abilities in marketing research with Information Resources Incorporated by helping companies make better business decisions. Previously completed an Applied Business Intelligence class at Northern Arizona University, gaining skills in RapidMiner and Tableau. Volunteer work with an NAU marketing professor creating a survey in Qualtrics demonstrated my ability to analyze data and gain insight from it. My analytical problem-solving abilities and excellent communication skills combined with strengths in collaborating across diverse groups, as evidenced by living in Sweden and working in Hungary, position me to provide organization leaders with information to make better informed decisions.</th>
